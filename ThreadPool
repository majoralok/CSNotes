Advantages of having thread Pool
  1. Avoid the overhead of Thread creation task for each incoming task. Use the same existing Threads.
  2. Skip the overhead of maintaining the lifespan of thread again & again.
  3. More threads means more context switching, so it improve performance by avoiding frequent context switch

How to decide number of threads in Multithreading architecture.
1. Depends on CPU cores, more cores can afford more threads, otherwise its just concurrent execution with no performance improvement.
2. JVM memory limit the number of threads creation, large memory can afford more threads
3. If task is cpu intensive then use low thread pool size.
4. If tasks are IO intensive then have thread count should be higher so that threads should not sit ideal for IO operation.
